Python tool to simulate and visualize EUR/USD forward rate projections under various USD interest rate cut scenarios, using historical dates and user-imported CSV data.
# EUR/USD Forward Rate Simulation

This Python tool allows you to simulate and visualize EUR/USD forward rate projections under various assumptions of USD interest rate cuts. The simulation uses interest rate parity formulas and a user-provided timeline of future dates imported from a CSV file.

##  Purpose

The goal is to assess the impact of different USD interest rate scenarios on the EUR/USD forward rate, based on an initial market configuration. This is particularly useful for financial analysts, traders, or corporate treasurers evaluating FX hedging strategies.

##  Features

- Load a list of future value dates from a CSV file
- Simulate forward rates based on interest rate parity formula
- Define scenarios with different levels of USD rate cuts
- Display interactive plots showing forward rate evolution
- Built-in graphical user interface for file selection

##  Methodology

The forward rate is computed using the formula: Forward = Spot × (1 + r_EUR × Δt) / (1 + r_USD × Δt)


    Where:
    - `r_EUR` is the current EUR interest rate (default: 4.00%)
    - `r_USD` is the current USD interest rate (default: 3.00%)
    - `Δt` is the time to maturity in days / 360

##  Requirements

    - Python 3.8+
    - Packages:
      - `pandas`
      - `matplotlib`
      - `tkinter` (built-in with most Python distributions)

Install dependencies (if needed):

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib

CSV Format
Your input CSV file must contain at least one column named date with dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
      
      Example:
      
      date
      2024-09-30
      2024-10-31
      2024-11-29


How to Use
      Run the script.
      
      A file selection dialog will appear.
      
      Choose your CSV file containing the future value dates.
      
      The simulation will generate a plot comparing:
      
      The current forward curve
      
      The forward curves under various USD rate cut scenarios (default: -25bps, -50bps, -100bps)

Customization
      You can modify the following default values directly in the script:
      
      taux_eur = 4.00       # EUR interest rate
      taux_us_initial = 3.00  # Initial USD interest rate
      spot_eurusd = 1.11667   # Spot EUR/USD rate
      start_date = datetime(2024, 8, 27)  # Pricing date
      taux_us_baisse_points = [0.25, 0.50, 1.00]  # Simulated rate cuts
